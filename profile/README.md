# UnderDoc

## What is UnderDoc?

UnderDoc is a simple, easy to use and cost effective document understanding platform.

With the latest GenAI technologies, many LLMs can now accept multi-modal inputs (e.g. images) and produce structured output base user instructions and the content/layout appeared on images.

Our mission is to leverage these exciting technologies to re-imagine how document understanding can be done.
